              <h3>Who We Are</h3>
              <p>We are a nonprofit organization of doctors, educators, and leaders united by a shared commitment to precision upper cervical care. Our members practice across the country and around the world, but we share a common language: the Advanced Orthogonal technique.</p>
              <p>What sets us apart isn't just the technique—it's the culture. AOI was founded on the belief that doctors grow best when they learn together, challenge one another, and share what works. We are clinicians first. We teach what we practice, and we practice what we teach. When you train with us, you're learning from doctors who are in the trenches every day, refining their skills and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in patient care.</p>
              <h3>What We Believe</h3>
              <p>We believe that precision matters—not for its own sake, but because your patients deserve care that is accurate, reproducible, and grounded in sound biomechanics and neurology.</p>
              <p>We believe that growth is a lifelong pursuit. No matter how experienced you are, there's always more to learn, and we've designed our training pathways to meet you wherever you are and take you further.</p>
              <p>We believe that collaboration accelerates progress. The most important breakthroughs in this work have come not from individuals working alone, but from doctors sharing insights, questioning assumptions, and building on one another's discoveries.</p>
              <p>And we believe that you belong here. Whether you trained in Atlas Orthogonal, Orthospinology, EPIC, or are brand new to upper cervical care—if you're committed to precision and excellence, there's a place for you at AOI.</p>

              <p>The Advanced Orthogonal Institute is founded on the advancements of the chiropractic profession dating back to the original upper cervical philosophy presented by B.J. Palmer, and the extensive research by John F. Grostic, D.C., the developer of Orthogonal chiropractic. In the same nature as the Institute was founded on advancement to upper cervical chiropractic care, the Institute will continue to grow, expand, and refine the technique and procedure.</p>
              <p>The Advanced Orthogonal Institute and its affiliated doctors are constantly striving to incorporate the latest research in chiropractic, developments in upper cervical care, and breaking discoveries in neurology. Furthermore, the Institute is dedicated to participating in and initiating research to further validate the functional and neurological changes of specific upper cervical procedures.</p>
