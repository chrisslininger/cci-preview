              <p>As a member, you not only guide the future of the organization through your voice and your vote, but you also gain access to essential resources designed to propel your career as an Advanced Orthogonal doctor and strengthen your expertise in the upper cervical specialty.</p>
              <p>The culture of our Institute—built on trust, collaboration, and shared purpose—is the fuel that drives innovation and growth. Together, our members pool resources, advance research, and pursue key goals that shape the future of Advanced Orthogonal care.</p>
              <h3>Who is membership for?</h3>
              <p>Membership in the Advanced Orthogonal Institute is intentionally broad and inclusive. Membership is open to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Veteran AdvO Doctors</b> — ongoing opportunities to continue training, shape the future of the organization, and, for those who are certified, pursue eligibility for board membership.</li>
                <li><b>Students</b> — access to resources that accelerate your learning and prepare you for a successful career.</li>
                <li><b>A.O. or EPIC Doctors</b> — a powerful way to accelerate your cross-training and certification, with a professional home and opportunities to engage in events and collaborative projects.</li>
                <li><b>Other Upper Cervical Chiropractors</b> — for doctors trained in other upper cervical techniques who want to transition into Advanced Orthogonal, refine their approach, or cross-train to expand their expertise.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This is not a closed membership requiring prior certification. Instead, it serves as the gateway to growth—an open access point designed to accelerate your learning, strengthen your expertise, and expand your professional opportunities.</p>
