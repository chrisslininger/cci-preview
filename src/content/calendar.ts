 * The standing event calendar.
 *
 * The Board adopted these as rules, not dates: every recurring event falls on
 * an ordinal weekday ("third Friday of October"), so its dates are computed
 * here and nothing has to be retyped each year. The member database still
 * holds one event per weekend (price, seats, attendees); each event's slug is
 * built from its rule and year so the site finds it without being edited.
 *
 * Dates are worked out from `AS_OF`, the day the site was built, so the
 * calendar rolls forward with each deploy and the browser's first render
 * agrees with the prerendered HTML. A component that must show today's answer
 * recomputes after mount with the built value as its fallback.
 *
 * supabase/functions/roll-calendar creates the matching events from the same
 * rules; keep the two in step.
