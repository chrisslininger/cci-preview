The Institute and the technique are at one: modernizing the work while building on the foundation that brought us here. Across two days at the Pierce Clinic of Chiropractic — the home of Advanced Orthogonal — the program takes that on directly: cone-beam CT and three-dimensional reference frames, updated terminology and corrective positioning, Sonus: Blueprint, the practice-based research project, and the clinical questions that decide whether a correction holds.</p><p>Thirteen presenters, fourteen instructional hours, and the case studies that only this community can share. It is also the Institute’s working weekend — the research initiative, the instructor pathway, and the announcements for 2027 — where the membership’s voice shapes the year ahead.</p>',
